In Objective-C, a rare but impactful bug can arise from the misuse of the `retain` and `release` methods in manual memory management (MRC).  Specifically, if you fail to balance `retain` calls with corresponding `release` calls, you create memory leaks (if you retain too much) or crashes (if you release too much). This is particularly insidious because sometimes the crashes or leaks happen seemingly unrelated to the code with the imbalance, due to how memory management works internally.
