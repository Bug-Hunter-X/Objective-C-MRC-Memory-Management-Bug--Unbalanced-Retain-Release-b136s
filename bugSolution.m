The solution involves carefully reviewing object ownership and ensuring that every `retain` call is matched with a `release` call using `autorelease` or `release`.  Using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) is strongly recommended to avoid these types of errors.  If you cannot use ARC, diligent testing and memory profiling are crucial.

Here's the corrected code:

```objectivec
// bugSolution.m
@implementation MyClass
- (id)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        // ...
    }
    return self;
}

- (void)doSomethingWithObject:(MyOtherClass *)anObject {
    [anObject retain]; // Retain the object
    // ... use anObject ...
    [anObject release]; // Release the object
}

- (void)dealloc {
    // Release any remaining retained objects here
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```
Using autorelease is another common approach:
```objectivec
[[anObject retain] autorelease];
// ... use anObject ...
// No need for explicit release here, autorelease handles it.
```
